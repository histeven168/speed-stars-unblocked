# speed-stars-unblocked
Speed Stars Unblocked is a rhythm-first sprinting game where precision, cadence, and posture decide the race. Developed by Luke Doukakis and released in November 2024, it blends simple inputs with a high skill ceiling: alternate strides to build speed, stabilize with subtle leans, and time your finishing kick.
